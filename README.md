# react-app
This repository was created using the vite format of creating react apps
I chose to use typescript for my code, which was later converted into Javascript code for the computer to understand my commands.
Vite gives a variety of different frameworks and in this case, i chose react for the particular application 
Then, with the help of npm, I installed the required packages to support the execution and performance of the app.
